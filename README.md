**--------- Read questions 2, 3 after having answered question 1**

**3)** In the proposition that you have chosen (A, B or C) how much do you want to investigate / know more about ? Pick a number between 1 (1 = tab already closed) and 10 (10 = I absolutely want to know more and already told one coleague about dappy).

**4)** In the proposition that you have chosen (A, B or C), did you understand that dappy is a name system that is independant of DNS ?

**5)** In the proposition that you have chosen (A, B or C), did you understand that the name system also handles TLS certificates for secure communications, and therefore does not use the TLS Certificate Authorities system (like Let's Encrypt or sectigo SSL) ?

**6)** In the proposition that you have chosen (A, B or C), what are the products or solutions that you instantly thought as similar solutions / competitors to what you heave read ?

**7)** Do you think DNS is great and are you satisfied with it ? If no what is the thing you don't like ? (management / lack of security / lack of privacy / security issues / centralization etc...)

**8)** Do you think TLS Certificate Authority system is great and are you satisfied with it ? If no what is the thing you don't like ? (renewal of certificate is painful / visibility is bad / revokation is hard / lack of security / lack of privacy / centralization etc...)
